What is a metasearch engine? There are too many explaination you can find on Internet. Here is what I think. Metasearch is not a 'search engine'! It's a 'thief'! It 'steal' the result
from other search engines like Google, Bing, etc. But metasearch will analyze all the result it got, and give user the best result. So, metasearch is a search engine of search engine,
and best part of it is drawing irrelevant and redundancy results by using some algorithm. From the Ch4 intro part, we could know, if we want to establish a connection between 
a metasearch engine and a search engine, there are 2 things we should do: connector and result extractor. 

Before talking about these two, let's talk about HTTP form tag. In a HTTP form of search engine, there contains an input control of text type( creat an input field), an action 
attribute( specifies the name and location of search engine server to which the user query will be sent when the form is submitted), a submit input control ( define the name of 
the submit button), and a method attribut (specifies the HTTP method for sending the query to the search engine server). In method, there are 2 types we need to understand, 
get and post. Get has a limited size of user input and characters user can use, and also permits only the retrieval of information from a remote server, and foremost it is not secure 
for transmitting important data over the Internet. In contrast, there is no limit size or character on post, and post may request storing and updating data in addition to retrieving 
information. It is not easy to understand right? Let's talk it more noob way, my way. Get likes 'SELECT' in SQL, and post likes 'UPDATE', one is for getting information from server and
the other one is for sending information to update/ create resource for server. Not only these reasons, also, search engines users don't need high-level secure and their inputs 
are short; get request can be bookmarked, for those same search input, server could give answer more quickly.
