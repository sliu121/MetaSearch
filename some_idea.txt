I will combine Chinese and English in this file, 就是为了能让自己思路更好一点. 

First, 既然我们现在的操作网站是必应，那么我们就不需要考虑太多了。根据我们拿到的bing的HTML代码，我发现< main arial-label = "Search Results"> 之后的内容是我们想
要的SRRs。For now, my thought is brute force, so, for reduce time cost, I should give a program that we only watch those codes below <main> part. 

For every result we got a <h2>"link" + "title"</h2>, so all we need is 把链接和标题从这里抓取下来。

Now I have found search result, how about using brute force method find where it is, and then use substring to get the propsed part. 
'''
for(int i = 0;i<str_diff_len;i++){
            if(str1.substring(i,i+str2_len).equals(str2)){
                return str1.substring(i,str1.length()-1);
            }
        }
'''

I also found that for every SRRs, there is a class label = "b_algo" so maybe we can separate according to this? 那样的话是不是会增加time cost 啊 

所以我们先不要考虑b_algo的东西，我们走一下原来的方法h2

it works. But there is a serious problem! For the return value, 这个hashmap/hashtable的返回值一直是在原有的基础上往上添加，而且存储到save.html的codes好像没变化。。。

问题先留着：
1. 返回值是叠加式的，上一个程序的结果也会再次输出。
2.html的内容好像没变。

可能问题-> 1. 你在写入文件的时候是不是没有删除掉以前的内容？（貌似不是这个原因）Did you overwrtie the file?
                    2. 是不是因为HashMap/HashTable的初始化问题？    Did you initiate HashMap?
                    3. 是不是Hash Table/ HashMap需要清理?                   Did you clear HashMap?

I have solved last problem I had yesterday, the problem is FileWriter function. In this function, there are 2 parameters, one is filename, the other one is append and it is boolean.
In append parameter, if you use true, FileWriter will start to write at the end of the file, if use false, it will overwrtie the file. 

Now, I need to extract link and title. it would be easy since link has "http" and before title there is a " "> ". So using another brute force method. 

Ok for link part : left side should be "http" since there may be some http and https webs together, we consider http first. Then right side we consider " \" ", " would appear when 
it is end of the href. 
For title part: left side should be ">\"", which the last part of <a...> the right part is </a> the edge of the whole string. 

今日问题-> 1. Why it would give me some results that are not shown on the page sometimes?
                    2. Some times results are different in a same page.
